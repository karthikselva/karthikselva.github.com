![Firefox](http://www.geekpedia.com/gallery/fullsize/firefox-a-star-is-born-wallpaper.jpg)

Firefox , a revolution in browser's history  .
   1. Firefox — 45.7%
   2. Internet Explorer — 38.7%
   3. Safari — 8.75%
   4. Chrome — 5.2%

As you can see, competition in the browser market is still alive and well. Of everything available, Firefox still continues to be my primary browser for every day usage. 


so Firefox users ,  lets celebrate the  fifth official B day of Firefox :)
