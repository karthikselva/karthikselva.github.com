## How it started 

I started my coding in a windows XP with notepad. 
I can realize now how terrible it was.
Then I came through a term called IDE which has everything a programmer 
needs in one place. Starting with netbeans for java 
and some random Junit test tools in eclipse , I really regreted for 
wasting my time in notepad. 

Most of the times I used to do one among these listed items apart from real typing/coding:

+ Searching the API sheet for exact name of method 
  + In Java typically confused with length() , size() , count or length variable usage
  + I know rubyists , ruby has everything

+ Missing ( , { or some parantheses ( not as much careless as initial days  )
  + I remember my first programming lab on c which I spent most of my time in figuring out the matching parantheses for the code I copied from internet 

+ Variable declared with one name but using it with different name 
    + I used to decalre a variable with User#name  and trying to access with User#username 

+ Version control integration 
    + Version control itself is a different topic to discuss for hours 
    + I use some set of plugins to commit and revert ( which I don't even bother on what command it is being translated on in background )
