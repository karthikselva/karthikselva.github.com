Well few days Back I heard something called new orkut . It took weeks before since last time I logged in  Orkut . Facebook attracted me more and some how addicted to it .Now heard about** "New Orkut "** I came back to my old orkut :) .





Goodness I got invite from some one ( sad thing is New Orkut too is a** Invite and use system** ). Well when I saw try new orkut at top , Clicked it really expecting a amazing wonder as an Alice . But I seen a page something very similar to face-book which disappointed me a lot .





_What they say new in this version are ..._





i) They say '** Friends updates are available to every one** ' .. Do you guess this thing new as an FB user  :P





ii) second '**Every one can comment on any friends notification** , updates ,application and friend acceptance ' .





iii) A new thing I found interesting is** Video chatting integrated** with orkut ( pity on Linux users , it says ' OS not supported ')





iv) Best feature I found in this release is **IE 6** is not at all supported :) .





v) Next humorous thing I found is adding a general sucky template  and five sticky colors  of their own  choice and  they said  " **Pick your favorite colors We've made orkut even more colorful **"  ..





**vi) Speed** is the main thing they mentioned they have increased .. But instead of static pages I can see my page still buffering in status bar  ( stealing my pity small free  download limit I have :( )





vii) And the highlight of all is they mentioned **moving chat bar from left side to right side** as a new feature :D ( I guess the only thing they didnt imitate is the notification bar you can see under  as In face Book )

I guess it may take time to  digest this things and to switch over to new orkut .  The thing I like the most is the prefix **Beta** in Orkut  ( a word which can answer almost  all the bugs  user raises :P  )
