well this morning I received a flash embedded scrap from my friend and I'm really afraid and searched for web cam's all around and even tried after disconnecting from net  what a shit  worked too :(


Now take a try of this application as many times as possible till you find it fails , and  let they accept you cheated it ...


**[Mind reader](http://www.orkut-scrapping.com/img/special/mindreader.swf)**( remember its a flash application )




Now come back here .. Guess you must anxious and afraid how it works exactly as your mind thinks it   ( the same situation where I'm few hours before )



I tried it as many times as possible  , this happened unless my browser crashed and till I'm satisfied that it's not a trial and error 

 I thought in different angle as I can ,  whether they trace thro' webcam , with my angle of inclination of head ,etc etc,.

Then I really thought how stupid I'm when i keenly watched the application for several times .


well guess you tried it before and now what makes a application less than 100 kb to guess what your mind reads 

**
A simple logic now keenly watch all the logos in multiples of 9 ..( Thats what you are going to get   :P)**


and try now you got the thing ( if you didn't know its logic so far ) and see how many pale faces are still waiting to be cheated :D
