Well Google is a  is an American public corporation, earning revenue from advertising related to its Internet search, e-mail, online mapping, office productivity, social networking, and video sharing services as well as selling advertising-free versions of the same technologies. Google has also developed an open source web browser and a mobile operating system.  


Recently I heard about something like a Browser called** chrome **and Latest **Wave** ( every one fights for it ) and another project recently put on my ears is **Google go .**


**
Whats it exactly ?**

 well name doesn't reveal any of its identity about the product ( similar to every open source softwares does ;))  is a new language  gonna be developed by Google team nearly 5 years of hard work from now .



Google's Go could improve on existing programming languages by simplifying development without sacrificing application performance, but it will likely take years for Go to attain an established position that will allow it to have a noticeable impact.


**Google GO Team :**

well as ** Wales** said about Google go :

_" Go's syntax friendly, with a clean feel to it like Python's and Ruby on Rails', while also familiar to the syntax of C-based languages. He also likes that, as a compiled language, Go's applications run extremely fast. "_






I dono what this guys gonna do with Python and Ruby rather stay away from this field ..




If its a productive and cleaner language well other than  few years of dumping its library and making its syntax familiar , its a less burden thing for me :)


But this guys sucked at chromium ( Linux edition of chrome ) with loads and loads of fatal errors and shooting bugs . 

well let them fix it since its in beta till .

I remember  the  inspiring history of Google and its growth 

But what happend to this guys at present   copying a pokemon ball ,  tracing a bull shit logo .. 






**Copying a pokemon ball and made it as chrome :**

in the list of thousands and thousands of burdens which already exists  ;)
