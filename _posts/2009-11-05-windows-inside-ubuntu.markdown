               If you are a newbee to ubuntu  or cant leave some of  the features of windows then best way to use virtual os. 

Now make your gui easier  and use both at same time.

Install **virtualbox **a free virtual os manager from sun microsystems .


**sudo apt-get install virtualbox**



run as super user (or else you may get errors at times )



**sudo virtualbox**



install the virtual os  , before that create a ** virtual hard disk **of required size 




go to the settings tab of virtualbox and


 **mount the xp or vista iso image **

click start button and you must get a boot option do as prompted


then on the mode use 


**seamless mode**



thats it ! now you can use both OS with  single interface 


Demo video is here .. you can have a look at it  ;)
