**As for Google mentioned :**

_" Google Chrome OS is an open source, lightweight operating system that will initially be targeted at net-books. Later this year we will open-source its code, and net books running Google Chrome OS will be available for consumers in the second half of 2010. Because we’re already talking to partners about the project, and we’ll soon be working with the open source community, we wanted to share our vision now so everyone understands what we are trying to achieve. "_

But the **major leaks **I found is every file you store move or even trash happens to be in remote server .

It is similar to saying even your personal credential files will be exposed to them and your only allocated necessary privileges to access the files . I dono how far it is gonna be secure .

Persons with limited network bandwidth will be harder to use because  each operation is a complicated network oriented .

Third even if I have huge hard disk say several TB's we are forced to access file from/to network which adds on burden for traditional off-line users .

As they mentioned  Chrome OS as LIGHT WEIGHT  BROWSER BASED OS they doesn't seem to match with high end gaming as well as with advanced hardware and software support . They seem to simplify more as only single processor is utilized even you have multi-core's.( Under utilization of available resource as far as I learnt :))

Guess this is a better matched OS for atom based processors and x86 series.

well  this time Im expecting a** real worthy  OS from Google **( rather years ago I got a distro named GOS which is nothing rather than a new Themed Ubuntu :P)

Free open source and Linux kernel are the pleasing words , as for as the project is concerned which gained my attention.
